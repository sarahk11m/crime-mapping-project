<p>For college students in Chicago and their families, safety is a central concern. While 
fears about crime influence decisions on where to attend school or live, particularly when 
news headlines and social media amplify those fears, the data presents a more complex picture. 
Each campus has distinct crime patterns that differ from citywide trends. Drawing on data from 
the City of Chicago, the Evanston Police Department, and the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer, this 
story breaks through the punchy media crime headlines and examines the realities of crime near 
UChicago, DePaul, Loyola, and Northwestern.</p>

<p>Before examining the Chicago data, it is important to note that campus safety is a 
significant factor in how students and families make decisions, rather than a secondary 
concern. Northwestern Mother Elizabeth Kim said, “I didn’t want my daughter to apply to 
Chicago because one of my coworker’s daughters had a friend who was shot and killed waiting 
for the train near the UChicago campus. That was enough for me. I didn’t want my daughter 
applying there.” In addition to parental concerns, a survey by BestColleges found that 60% of 
students and prospective students take safety into account when picking a school 
(BestColleges), while another ADT and the Clery Center survey showed that over 80% of college 
students worry about their personal safety on campus (ADT Newsroom). For this reason, it is 
crucial to move beyond fear-driven narratives and consider what the data reveals.</p>

<p>Let’s start with The University of Chicago, which is often perceived as less safe due to 
its location in Hyde Park on the city’s South Side. According to 2024 data from the Chicago 
Data Portal, theft is the most common crime within a half-mile of the campus, with 177 
reported incidents. Battery follows with 139 cases, and criminal damage and motor vehicle 
theft round out the top five. Interestingly, UChicago accounts for nine firearm-related 
incidents, a number higher than those reported by both Loyola and DePaul, which each had one. 
So, while UChicago’s overall crime volume may be lower, violent incidents there can feel more 
severe.</p>

<p>This sense of heightened risk around UChicago is also reflected in the broader emergency 
call activity for the district it sits within. Annual data from the Chicago Police Department 
for 2023 shows that while District 11 had the highest number of 911 calls citywide (over 
168,000), District 2, where UChicago is located, also ranks among the top in call volume.</p>

<p>In comparison to UChicago, DePaul and Loyola report higher overall crime counts. Loyola 
recorded 543 thefts, the most among the three campuses, while DePaul reported 480. Both 
campuses also saw over 100 incidents of battery. Time of day is another factor in the crime 
data. At Loyola, there were 772 incidents reported during the day and 564 at night. DePaul’s 
figures are nearly identical, with 595 daytime incidents and 583 at night. UChicago, in 
contrast, saw 394 incidents during daylight hours compared to 287 at night, indicating that 
daytime does not always translate to a heightened sense of safety.</p>

<p>Data on victims within a one mile radius of Loyola, UChicago, and DePaul shows that young 
adults aged 20–29 accounted for the largest share of serious incidents near these campuses. 
However, this likely includes crimes that happened nearby and not necessarily involving 
students.</p>

<p>Outside Chicago, data from the Evanston Police Department offers a look at crime patterns 
near Northwestern University. Their dashboards indicate that aggravated assaults reached a 
peak of 15 cases in early 2021 but have since declined to fewer than six per month. 
Larceny-theft remains the most frequent crime, with monthly cases peaking at approximately 225 
in 2023. Homicides are rare, with small increases in some years, and most cases are resolved 
quickly. Rape and robbery figures are more inconsistent, with spikes in some months and no 
incidents in others.</p>

<p>The FBI’s Crime Data Explorer offers a federally reported perspective on crime in Evanston. 
It shows that larceny-theft is the most common crime, with monthly reports often topping 100 
and reaching 225 in mid-2023, though clearance rates remain low. Robberies range from two to 
10 incidents monthly, with improved clearance rates in the past year. Homicides are rare and 
usually resolved, while rape cases occasionally spike, peaking at six in early 2024. This FBI 
data highlights persistent property crime challenges, even as violent crime investigations 
show progress.</p>

<p>Data alone does not always capture the full reality. A single theft or assault can really 
impact a person’s sense of safety, regardless of overall crime counts. Yet by pulling together 
data from multiple sources, I hope this story creates a more accurate picture of campus safety 
in Chicago.</p>
